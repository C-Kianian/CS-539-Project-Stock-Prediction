# CS-539-Project-Stock-Prediction
Includes: 
- MLP
- Forest-CLAM
   - Developement Workflow: LSTM -> CLAM -> RandomForest -> RandomForest + CLAM -> Forest-CLAM
   - LSTM
      - Code: initial_LSTM.ipynb
      - Accuracy: Low (~50%)
      - though low accuracy, we still decided to give LSTM a try by changing it to a hybrid model
      - leading up to CLAM...
   - CLAM (best path ForestCLAM_CLAM attached on github)
      - Code: CNN_LSTM_Attention_Model.ipynb
      - Checkpoint: ForestCLAM_CLAM.pth
      - Accuracy: ~70%
   - Random Forest (best path too large for github)
      - Code: RandomForest.ipynb
      - Checkpoint: Decison tree yeilds consistent results and is too large to save, so it needs to be trained
      - Accuracy: ~80%
   - Forest-CLAM
      - Code: RandomForest_CNN_LSTM_Attention_Model.ipynb
      - the best CLAM check point is saved
      - Total Gain: ~200%+ compared to initial capital
   - Data used for CLAM and Forest models
      - Directory: Data_for_Forest_CLAM
      - Companies (5): AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, META, MSFT
